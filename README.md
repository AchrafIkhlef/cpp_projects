### 1. Digital Clock Project

Description: A command-line digital clock application developed using C++ to display the current time with customizable input for hours, minutes, and seconds.

#### Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Digital Clock_Project` directory.
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o clock`).
4. Run the executable file (`clock.exe` on Windows or `./clock` on Unix-based systems).
5. Enter the desired values for hours, minutes, and seconds when prompted.
6. The digital clock will display the current time and update every second.

### 2. ATM Project

Description: A simple ATM simulator implemented in C++ to demonstrate basic programming concepts such as user input, conditional statements, and functions.

#### Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `ATM_Project` directory.
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o atm`).
4. Run the executable file (`atm.exe` on Windows or `./atm` on Unix-based systems).
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the ATM simulator.
